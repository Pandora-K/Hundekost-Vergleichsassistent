# Dog Food Comparison Assistant

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The AI analyzes various dog food brands and recommends the most suitable one based on the specific needs of a dog.


## Background

The dog food comparison assistant solves the problem of providing dog owners with a well-informed, personalized, and time-saving decision-making aid in the selection of dog food, ultimately contributing to the health and well-being of their pets. This includes individual nutritional needs, ingredient analysis, veterinary recommendations, user-friendliness, timeliness of recommendations, and local availability and budget.


This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Individual nutritional needs
* ingredient analysis
* veterinary recommendations
* user-friendliness
* timeliness of recommendations
* local availability and budget


## Used by dog owners, veterinarians, or anyone seeking information.

## Machine Learning (ML):

Classification: Used to classify dog food products based on the individual needs of the dog, such as whether it is suitable for a puppy, an adult dog, or an older dog.
Regression: Can be used to predict the nutrient content of the food based on the nutritional needs of the dog.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Understanding Customer Reviews: Analyzing customer reviews and comments on dog food products to understand consumer feedback and incorporate it into recommendations.
Expert Systems:

Veterinary Recommendations: Integration of expert knowledge regarding canine nutrition by incorporating veterinary recommendations and nutritional guidelines.
Data Analysis and Mining:

Ingredient Analysis: By mining large amounts of data on ingredient lists, the AI can identify trends in the quality of ingredients and incorporate this into recommendations.
Reinforcement Learning:

User Behavior: By observing user behavior, the AI can learn which recommendations are more effective and adjust its recommendations accordingly.
Recommendation Systems:

Collaborative Filtering: Analyzing behavioral patterns of other dog owners with similar dogs to generate recommendations based on their preferences.
Cluster Analysis:

Segmentation of Dog Groups: Grouping dogs with similar needs to create personalized recommendations for specific segments.
It is important to carefully integrate these techniques to ensure an effective and user-friendly application. Additionally, the AI should be continuously improved by responding to new data and user interactions.
